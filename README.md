- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaFeLop otherwise known as "R34S0N", which is my screen name! No quotation marks though, my friends call me Manu.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and sports, I sort of like videogames, but they take little precedence in my life now, I'm more passoinate about self improvement now, and I also like anime.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in The Odin Project, learning HTML, and CSS. Java, Ruby, and so much more is what I am aiming to learn.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing as of this moment, I have progressed enough to understand that I want to develop myself first then jump straight into a big project. In the future I would love to collaborate on a website. 
- I know spanish as my first language, english as my second language, and french as my third language, albeit much less than the former two.
- 📫 How to reach me? By my discord handle: R34S0N#7684 and also with my buisness email: felizmanuel512@gmail.com
